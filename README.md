4. Use Excel's PivotTable feature to summarize and aggregate your data, allowing you to easily analyze trends and patterns.
5. Write SQL queries to extract the relevant data from your database and export it to a CSV or Excel file.
6. Use Excel's Power Query feature to clean and transform your SQL data as necessary.
7. Merge your SQL data with your Excel data using unique identifiers, such as customer or product IDs.
8. Use Excel's conditional formatting to highlight any outliers or anomalies in your data.
9. Create charts and graphs in Excel to visualize your data and identify any trends or patterns.
10. Export your cleaned and transformed data from Excel to Tableau.
11. Connect Tableau to your data source and use the Data Interpreter feature to clean and transform your data as necessary.
12. Create a Tableau Workbook to organize your data and visualize your insights.
13. Use Tableau's drag-and-drop interface to create interactive dashboards, charts, and graphs.
14. Use Tableau's filters and parameters to allow users to interact with your data and explore different scenarios.
15. Use Tableau's calculations and formulas to create custom metrics and calculations.
16. Use Tableau's Table Calculation feature to create advanced calculations and visualizations.
17. Create a story in Tableau to tell a compelling narrative using your data.
