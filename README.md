### Process:
Steps:
20 actionable steps to help you create a Data Analysis project using Excel, SQL, and Tableau:

1. Asses
    * Define the scope of the analysis project and identify the business problem to be solved.
    * Gather the relevant data sources and store them in a format that is easy to analyze (e.g. CSV, Excel, or database).
2. Data Cleaning
    * Import the data into Excel and use the Data tab to clean and transform the data as necessary (e.g. remove duplicates, fill in missing values).
    * Use Excel's PivotTable feature to summarize and aggregate the data to easily analyze trends and patterns.
    * Write SQL queries to extract the relevant data from the database and export it to a CSV or Excel file.
        * How does this process work? Should I import it all into excel and sort with SQL? Or use SQL first in a CSV to create a new and concise Excel file?
    * Use Excel's Power Query feature to clean and transform the SQL data as necessary.
    * Merge your SQL data with your Excel data using unique identifiers, such as customer or product IDs.
3. EDA
    * Use Excel's conditional formatting to highlight any outliers or anomalies in your data.
    * Create charts and graphs in Excel to visualize the data and identify any trends or patterns.
4. Visualization + EDA
    * Export the cleaned and transformed data from Excel to Tableau.
    * Connect Tableau to the data source and use the Data Interpreter feature to clean and transform the data as necessary.
    * Create a Tableau Workbook to organize the data and visualize insights.
    * Use Tableau's drag-and-drop interface to create interactive dashboards, charts, and graphs.
    * Use Tableau's filters and parameters to allow users to interact with the data and explore different scenarios.
    * Use Tableau's calculations and formulas to create custom metrics and calculations.
    * Use Tableau's Table Calculation feature to create advanced calculations and visualizations.
5. Story Telling and Publication
    * Create a story in Tableau to tell a compelling narrative using your data.
    * Use Tableau's publishing feature to share your analysis with stakeholders or colleagues.
    * Get feedback on your analysis and make any necessary adjustments or improvements.
    * Repeat the process to update your analysis with new data or insights as needed.
